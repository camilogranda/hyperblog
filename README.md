## Welcome!

This is a test repository for Git and Github Platzi course.
So far, there's a Claude Monet's artwork called 
[*Impression, Sunrise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression,_Sunrise) in the blogspot.html file, nothing more. 

Maybe, it is a good idea to post beautiful paintings on this website.
Here is a list of interesting artists to keep in mind:
- Francisco de Goya
- Leonardo da Vinci
- El Greco
- Berthe Morisot
- Edvard Munch
- Remedios Varo
- Paul Klee

Thanks for reading!
